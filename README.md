# BLE Beacon Data Processing Sample
This repo contains two projects which are part of bigger solution for real time location tracking using Bluetooth Low Energy technology. There is plenty of different scenarios, in which it is possible to utilize such tracking feature and almost all of them has something in common. It is large number of messages generated by devices. To be able to process such amount of data, we decided to utilize Azure Cloud services, to be able to scale the solution with growing base of users.  Data flow within the solution is following:

BLE Beacon -> Mobile/IoT Device with receiving application -> Azure Event Hub -> Azure Function Processing and location calculation -> Database -> Visualization of data thru Web App.

In this repository we are publishing following portions of this solution:

- UWP application, which communicates with BLE Beacons and sends data to Azure Event Hub. 
- Azure Function triggered by Event Hub message which processes data send by devices
